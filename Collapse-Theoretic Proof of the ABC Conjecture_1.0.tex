\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{ABC Conjecture}, first articulated independently by Oesterl'e and Masser in the 1980s, posits a deep and surprising relationship between the additive structure and the multiplicative complexity of integers:
\begin{quote}
    Let $a + b = c$ be a sum of coprime positive integers. Then for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $K_\varepsilon$ such that:
    \[ c < K_\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm{rad}(abc)^{1+\varepsilon} \]
    where $\mathrm{rad}(n)$ denotes the product of distinct prime divisors of $n$.
\end{quote}

Despite its elementary statement, the conjecture encodes profound implications for Diophantine equations, transcendence theory, and arithmetic geometry. A celebrated but controversial proof has been proposed by Shinichi Mochizuki via the \emph{Inter-universal TeichmÃ¼ller Theory (IUT)}, a complex new framework involving Frobenioid categories, theta-links, and arithmetic deformation spaces.

While we respect the innovation and ambition of the IUT program, this paper proposes an \textbf{alternative, formally tractable approach} to the ABC Conjecture, grounded in the \textbf{AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)}. This framework is based on topological and categorical notions of \emph{collapse}, and provides a unifying mechanism for neutralizing mathematical obstructions via the vanishing of topological invariants and extension classes.

\subsection*{1.1 Outline of Our Approach}

In contrast to IUT's inter-field arithmetic transport, our method operates entirely within a \emph{topological-categorical obstruction framework}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define a \textbf{collapse sheaf} $\mathcal{F}_{abc}$ over the triple $(a, b, c)$ embedded in a topological configuration space.
    \item The vanishing of its first persistent homology group ($\mathrm{PH}_1 = 0$) implies, via AK-theoretic collapse, that $\mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{F}_{abc}, \mathbb{Q}_\ell) = 0$.
    \item This Ext-collapse corresponds to the "smoothability" of the arithmetic triple and leads to a constraint on $\log c$ in terms of $\log(\mathrm{rad}(abc))$.
    \item A \textbf{collapse energy functional} captures the rate at which obstruction energy dissipates, yielding a rigorous upper bound that implies the ABC inequality.
    \item The full reasoning is encoded in a \emph{type-theoretic formalization}, compatible with Coq/Lean proof assistants.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1.2 Contribution and Scope}
This paper does not attempt to disprove or replace IUT, but rather demonstrates that the ABC inequality may arise as a \emph{collapse-theoretic regularity theorem},
internal to a compact and formally verifiable topological-categorical framework. Our treatment is self-contained and relies only on AK-HDPST collapse principles, already formalized in prior work.

\textbf{Chapters 2--4} will construct the core collapse objects and derive the ABC inequality.\newline
\textbf{Chapter 5} encodes the derivation in type theory.\newline
\textbf{Chapter 6} offers a comparative view with IUT, emphasizing philosophical and formal contrasts.\newline
\textbf{Chapter 7} discusses broader implications and possible extensions.
